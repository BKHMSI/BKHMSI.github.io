Questions (Things I am not sure of)
1. High register operations, does it include h in the instruction // Change it all
2. Is there MOV Rd,Rs? It’s a pseudo-instruction
3. Overflow Flag // I think it’s ok
4  Carry Flag (in some operations) the same as we did in MIPS
5. How can the user load from memory data using label // LDR r1, =0xFFFF/=label
